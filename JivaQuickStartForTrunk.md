Note - the build.xml file within the Jiva directory is used by Netbeans. After you have run the above build step, you can open the Jiva project within Netbeans and compile/run Jiva from within Netbeans. You can also [build Jiva with Maven](BuildWithMaven.md).
  * Run one of the sample GA Problems:
```
jiva gaprob/NQueens.scala
```
> Jiva should come back with something like:
```
Best Fitness:8.0
Fittest Chr:[4, 1, 5, 0, 6, 3, 7, 2]
Time taken: 161 ms
```

At this point, you have a good, functioning installation of Jiva. Congratulations!

The next step is to define your own GA problems and get Jiva to run them. For help with this, look at:
  * [WhatAreGAs](WhatAreGAs.md)
  * [DefiningAndRunningGAProblems](DefiningAndRunningGAProblems.md)
  * SampleProblems

When you're ready to take things to the next level by defining your own GA problems for Jiva to solve:

  * Put your Java/Scala code under the `usr/` directory. Typically what you put here will be your fitness-functions and related helper classes
  * Run `ant -f usrBuild.xml` to build the code (if any) that you put under the `usr/` directory. The class-files generated by this step go under the `work/` directory
  * Or you can work with your code elsewhere, and just put your Java/Scala class-files under the `work/` directory
  * Put your GA problem definition under the `gaprob/` directory.
  * Finally, run your problem with jiva: `jiva gaprob/yourProb.scala`
