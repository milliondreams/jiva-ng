**`Jiva:`** a word in the _Sanskrit_ language that means - a living being; something that is alive.

**Jiva:** a problem solving toolkit based on ideas derived from the evolution of living creatures.


Jiva is a Genetic Algorithms (GA) toolkit written in a powerful and elegant language called [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), and runs on the Java Platform. Jiva provides a robust set of GA components that can be used out-of-the-box to solve real problems. Jiva also provides an extensible framework for the development and investigation of new variants of Genetic Algorithms.

Jiva is featured on the [Scala website](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1209#libraries) - on the _Contributed Libraries and Tools_ page.
